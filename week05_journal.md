## Content Insights

### WordPress Child Themes 👶:
- A child theme is a theme that **inherits** the functionality and styling of a parent theme, allowing for safe modifications.
- A child theme consists of at least 2️⃣ files:
    - style.css (for overriding styles)
    - functions.php (for adding custom functions)

### WordPress Hook Functions 🪝:
- Hooks allow developers to modify or extend WordPress functionality without changing core files.
- Hooks are categorised in **two main types**:
    - Actions 🎬 – Execute functions at specific points (e.g., when a post is published).
    - Filters 🎨 – Modify data before it is displayed or saved (e.g., changing content before output).

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

### Career:
- Freelancing 🌍 - WordPress development, especially using hooks and child themes, could be a potential career path.
    - Working on a beach in Southeast Asia does not sound bad at all 🏝️.
- Entrepreneurship 🚀 - Building and selling premium child themes or plugins on marketplaces like ThemeForest or CodeCanyon could also be another career path.
    - With enough users, I could launch my own brand and even create my own marketplace using WordPress!

### Employability:
- Building projects that showcase hooks, filters, and child themes might can potentially strengthen my resume and GitHub profile.
    - A strong portfolio means potential employers can see my skills in action instead of just relying on my interview pitch.

### Learning Insights:
- WordPress is deeper than I expected!
    - Initially, I saw WordPress as just a tool for building websites, but now I realize it’s a powerful development platform with extensibility through hooks and child themes.
