## Estimated Hours
~ 3 hours

## Content Insights
- Docker:
    - Dockerfile builds the image, which is the blue print for our software application (client side/server side).
    - Running the docker image creates the docker container (containers allows consistensy across different environments).
    - We are able to define multi-container applications with docker-compose.
    - Other people have experimented working with docker in different languages/frameworks and resources are available online (docker hub).
    - Kubernetes is the industry standard for managing a cluster of conatiners.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- Career:
    - I struggled to gain any meaningful career insights from this week’s learning.
    - I may have exhausted my insights after dedicating nine hours to learning last week.
    - Moving forward, I should specifically find career relevant information. 
    - I have decided to register to an event [Gateway to Tech Careers in Townsville - ACS Event](https://www.acs.org.au/cpd-education/event-detail.html?eventId=701Om00000IHFYFIA5).
    - I don't know what I don't know, Therefore, I think the best way to go about this is to talk to the experts.
- Employability:
    - Learning about Kubernetes and its complexity reinforced my awareness of how much there is still to learn in technology. It made me question why I had only encountered this technology now.
    - I belive exposure to industry standards (both software and practices) before graduating is highly beneficial. With this knowledge, I feel I have an advantage over my non-CMS peers—assuming we have similar levels of experience, expertise and goals.
- Learning Insights:
    - I may have overlearned in Week 1. I completed two WordPress courses without applying the knowledge in practical development.
    - While these courses satisfied my curiosity, I didn’t reinforce my learning through hands-on practice. As a result, I have forgotten much of the content and will likely need to revisit it when working on WordPress-related tasks.
    - The reason I didn’t think to create a WordPress project was that I prioritised deep-diving and catching up with other subjects.
    - I believe I would have practiced WordPress development if the coursework had required it. Would setting intentional learning constraints improve my retention, or was my lack of awareness the issue?
    - Perhaps my competitive nature hindered my learning progress. I aimed to consume information quickly and store it in my short-term memory, hoping I would instinctively recall it when needed. However, my ability to retain and apply this knowledge effectively is lacking.
