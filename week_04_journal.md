## Content Insights
### Kubernetes:
- Nodes: The physical or virtual machines that run workloads.
- Cluster: A group of nodes managed by Kubernetes.
- Control Plane: Manages the cluster, schedules workloads, and maintains desired states.
- Worker Nodes: Run application workloads in containers.
- Kubelet: An agent running on each node that communicates with the control plane.
- Atleast 2 servers are needed when deploying with Kubernetes.
    - 1 for the master server and one for a node.
- Kubernetes can automate many aspects of traffic distribution, theoretically making it easier, scalable, and more reliable compared to setting up load balancing manually.
    - For example, without Kubernetes: 
        - You need to setup a load balancer manually.
        - You must manually configure and update backend servers (IP addresses of running services).
        - If a server fails, you need to detect and remove it manually.
    - With Kubernetes:
        - Kubernetes automatically distributes traffic across available pods.
        - It keeps track of pod IPs and updates them dynamically.
        - Failed pods are removed from the load balancer automatically.

### WordPress:
- If WordPress is a mobile phone then **plugins** are the applications.
