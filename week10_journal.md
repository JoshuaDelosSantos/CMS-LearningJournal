# Week 10
This week, I focused on completing assessments.

## Learning Activities & Resources (outside this week's lecture videos)
During the week, I did not engage in any additional learning activities. I had already revised all topics relevant to the assignment and pracs, and I did not find the subject matter for this week sufficiently important or interesting to invest further time.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Reflecting on my approach this week, I considered my career, employability, and learning strategies.

### Career:
I reaffirmed my decision to pursue a career as either an AI Engineer or an Entrepreneur. I believe it is important to assess the relevance of learning materials in relation to my career goals, ensuring that my time is well spent. While developing a secure site (this week’s topic) offers valuable insights into best practices that could benefit my chosen path, it is not a priority for now. Nonetheless, I will keep the potential advantages of understanding this topic in mind for the future.

### Employability:
Although learning about WordPress security could add a useful skill to my CV, I do not plan to develop WordPress sites beyond the scope of this subject. However, understanding the fundamentals of website security—whether for WordPress or other platforms—will enhance my employability, especially as I consider roles in DevOps or higher-level positions such as a Chief Technology Officer.

### Learning Insights:
Selective learning is a powerful approach that allows me to focus on what truly matters. By prioritising essential topics aligned with my goals, I can work more efficiently and avoid unnecessary distractions. For example, with most assessments due this week, I chose to concentrate on practical activities rather than spreading my efforts too thinly across unrelated subjects.
