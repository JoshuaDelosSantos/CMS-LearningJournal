## Content insights
- I think **Docker** should be a core technology to be used when creating software for these reasons:
    - Theoretically enables our app to work the same on any modern machine.
    - Allows us to isolate our app in its own environment.
    - Scalability, able run multiple copies of the app. 
- I don't think I will be using **WordPress** outside of university for these reasons:
    - I believe as a beginner, it is necessary to learn the low level details (such as manually setting up auth, payment etc.)
    - Whilst its more efficient to use a CMS such as WordPress, I find it more fun and I am able to learn more from creating websites/software from scratch.
- Similar to Docker, I think it would be wise to learn about **Vagrant** for these reasons:
    - I think Vagrant would be useful in creating development environments that mimic production.
    - I think Vagrant is a key component to this subject that will allow us to test our website in a production like environment.
    - I read something about provisioners, which allows us to write bash scripts that can automate environment setup (such as downloading Nginx).

## Career/Employability/Learning insights
To be employable and to not be obselete within the next few years due to AI, I think it would be imperative to learn about the 'harder'/'less fun' parts of the tech world such as DevOps. As these are the type of work that might be replaced the longest, compared to front-end, back-end and database engineering.

Within the first week of this subject, it has become clear to me that I know less than what I don't know. This feeling can be compared to the observable universe in contrast to the theories of the unobservable universe.  I was only introduced to these technologies thanks to this subject.

I prefer the learning method of this subject compared to a more 'traditional' lecture video based content as this type of learning simulates the feeling of entrepreneurship for me, which makes it more fun and engaging.
