## Estimated hours
~ 4 hours

## Content insights
- I think **Docker** should be a core technology to be used when creating software for these reasons:
    - Ensures our app works the same on any machine.
    - Isolates our app in its own environment.
    - Scalability, can run multiple copies of the app. 
- I don't think I will be using **WordPress** outside of university for these reasons:
    - I believe as a beginner, it is necessary to learn the low level details (such as manually setting up auth, payment etc.)
    - I imagine that big companies create their own software from scratch to have granular access. 
- Similarly to Docker, I think it would be wise to learn about **Vagrant** for these reasons:
    - I think Vagrant would be useful in creating developemtn environments that mimic production.
    - Perhaps we could develop robotics software by hardware simulations?

## Career/Employability/Learning insights
To be employable and to not be obselete within the next few years due to AI, I think it would be imperative to learn about the 'harder'/'less fun' parts of the tech world. As these are the type of work that might be replaced the longest, compared to general coding.

Within the first week of this subject, it has become clear to me that I know less than what I don't know. I was only introduced to these technologies thanks to this subject.
