## Content insights
- I think **Docker** should be a core technology to be used when creating software for these reasons:
    - Theoretically enables our app to work the same on any modern machine.
    - Allows us to isolate our app in its own environment.
    - Scalability, able run to multiple copies of the app, making it ideal for handling increased user traffic.
- I don't think I will be using **WordPress** outside of university for these reasons:
    - As a beginner, I think it's crucial to understand the fundamentals of web development, such as manually setting up authentication and payments, before relying on CMS solutions like WordPress.
    - While CMS platforms like WordPress streamline development, I find that building websites from scratch offers a deeper learning experience and a greater sense of accomplishment.
- Similar to Docker, I think it would be wise to learn about **Vagrant** for these reasons:
    - I think Vagrant would be useful in creating development environments that mimic production.
    - I think Vagrant is a key component to this subject that will allow us to test our website in a production like environment.
    - I read something about provisioners, which allows us to write bash scripts that can automate environment setup (such as downloading Nginx).

## Career/Employability/Learning insights
Since AI is advancing rapidly, I believe DevOps skills will remain valuable longer than front-end, back-end, and database engineering, making them a crucial area to explore for job security.

Within the first week of this subject, it has become clear to me that I know less than what I don't know. This feeling can be compared to the observable universe in contrast to the theories of the unobservable universe.  I was only introduced to these technologies thanks to this subject.

I prefer the learning method of this subject compared to a more 'traditional' lecture video based content as this type of learning simulates the feeling of entrepreneurship for me, which makes it more fun and engaging.
