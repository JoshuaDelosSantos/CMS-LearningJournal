# Week 8

## Learning Activities & Resources (outside this week's lecture videos)
- [Building WordPress themes using underscores - LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-building-themes-from-scratch-using-underscores-2/welcome)

## Estimated Hours
~ 5 hours

## Content Insights
- This week's content was mainly for guidance in the group project and to acquire a general direction.
- I learned how to create a custom WordPress theme from [last week's](./week07_journal.md) learning activity.
- I am unable to extract any meaningful insights from this week's learning activity as it covers the same topic but on a more specialised scenario (using underscores stater theme).

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

### Career:
- As this week's content cover the same as last [last weeks'](./week07_journal.md) I am unable to extract any new meaningful career insights.
### Employability:
- As this week's content cover the same as last [last weeks'](./week07_journal.md) I am unable to extract any new meaningful employability insights.

### Learning Insights:

In [week 2](week02_journal.md) I hypothesised that by limiting my learning resources I would be able to focus more on the week's topic. This, in turn, would help me balance my time across all subjects and deepen my understanding.

#### Hypothesis
If I restrict my study materials to those directly related to the week's objectives, I can avoid distractions from extraneous content. This should lead to improved time management and a clearer focus on essential topics.

#### Experiment
- **Initial Approach:** In Weeks 1 and 2, I consumed a vast amount of content and unfamiliar terms. This overindulgence resulted in a superficial grasp of the material, as I frequently had to revisit slides or search online for clarification.
- **Refined Strategy:** Starting in Week 3, I limited myself to materials pertinent to the week's tasks. Although I considered recommendations from the subject repository, I primarily outsourced my own targeted resources.

#### Findings
- **Time Management:** Restricting my resources greatly improved my schedule, with my calendar displaying a more balanced allocation for all subjects.
- **Depth of Understanding:** Despite improved time management, I did not find measurable evidence of a deeper understanding. The extra time saved was not always directed towards reinforcing newly learnt knowledge.

Overall, while the approach enhanced my organisational skills, it did not conclusively deepen my comprehension of the subject matter.
