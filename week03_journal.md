## Estimated Hours
~ 2 hours


## Content Insights
- Since week 2, I have exhausted my learning resources.
    - To stay focused, I’ve set a learning constraint: only studying that week’s content.
    - This minimizes the gap between learning and hands-on practice.
    - I hypothesize that this approach will lead to deeper understanding of each topic.

- Docker vs Vagrant for local development:
    - After comparing the learn jcu vagrant tutorial to [local WordPress setup - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEceSAJI_3s) I became more interested in Docker!
    - [This ChatGPT conversation](https://chatgpt.com/share/67ac3110-af44-8012-93d6-6901f6158b13) also confirmed my interest by comparing and contrasting Docker and Vagrant.
    - Docker seems easier to use, only having to set up a docker-compose.yml file which will have all of the necessary images (db, php and wordpress server).
    - There might be a day where Vagrant would be the better local environment.
    - I will try and update this journal when that day comes. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Most of these insights were from the group interviews. For context, please read the [report](#group-interviews-report) below.

### Career:
- In leadership roles, observing how people react under pressure rather than relying solely on their stated skills may prove beneficial.
    - Having a deep understanding on team dynamics may allow a more optimised leadership approach.

### Employability:
- Taking action now is key—let achievements speak for themselves.
    - I believe side projects, volounteering, and hands on experience have more impact than GPA.

### Learning insights:
- Applied learning beats theoretical learning.
    - I enjoyed learning from doing things and reflecting rather than watching videos.


### Group Interviews report:

**Assumption:**
- Before the group interviews, I had assumptions about who I wanted to work with and who I preferred not to work with.

**Plan**
- Instead of conducting a 'traditional stlye' interview such as asking about their commitments for this subject, I decided to run a social interview.
- I don’t fully trust self-reported answers, especially when candidates have time to prepare.
- From experience, people tend to present themselves favorably, even if it means giving inaccurate or inflated responses.
    - Example: If asked, "How many hours are you willing to put into this subject?"
    - Most people would overestimate to appear more committed.
- I have done this myself in the past, and my experiment aimed to test whether others do the same (see Special Case).

**What I did**
- I used curveball questions/scenarios to provoke genuine reactions and validate my assumptions.
    - It is important to note: I assumed that IT students are not socially adept.
- I spoke loud and fast to induce quick thinking.
- I believe a person’s response under pressure reveals valuable insights:
    - Confident individuals may expose their true personality. Or they might read between the lines and proceed normally.
    - Introverted individuals may become more reserved, filtering their responses.
- Moreover, I believe most people like to talk about themselves.

**Hypothesis**
- If you get people talking and leave long pauses, they will feel the need to fill the silence with more details.

**Hypothesis results**
- The group interview confirmed this hypothesis.
- After a long pause, candidates voluntarily expanded on their responses—this extra detail was key!

**Conclusion**
- Everyone proved that my assumptions were correct.
- The individuals I expected to work well with “passed my test.”
- Those I was hesitant about responded as expected, reinforcing my initial impressions.

**Special case**
- I found additional evidence of inaccurate self-reporting.
- Since everyone received the same ChatGPT-generated questions, I used an accomplice to cross-check responses.
- I was able to compare answers from people with the help of an accomplice.
    - We identified discrepancies—some people provided contradictory answers!
    - I believe their responses to me were more accurate than their initial ChatGPT responses.
    - To verify this further, I would need to team up with them and observe firsthand.
