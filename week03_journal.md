## Estimated Hours
~ 2 hours


## Content Insights
- I have exhausted my learning resources since week 2.
    - I have decided to put a learning contraint by only learning about that week's content.
    - This is so that there is less time between my learning and hands on practice.
    - My hypothesis is that this approach will lead to a deeper undertanding on the topic.
- Docker vs Vagrant (local development):
    - After comparing the learn jcu vagrant tutorial to [local WordPress setup - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEceSAJI_3s) I became more interested in Docker!
    - [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/67ac3110-af44-8012-93d6-6901f6158b13) also confirmed my interest.
    - There might be a day where Vagrant would be the better local environment.
    - I will try and update this journal when that day comes. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- No meaningful career insights this week.
- No meaningful employability insights this week.
- Learning insights:
    - For this week's prac, we conducted group interviews.
    - Prior to the group interviews, I have made assumptions on who I would like to work with and vice versa.
    - My plan was to ask stray away from a 'normal' interview and instead to try a more social experiment.
    - I don't trust what anyone says about themselves, especially when they have notice to plan their responses.
    - From my previous experiences, people don't want to seem incompetent infront of their interviewer/peer.
    - I believe this results in untrue statements (I can attest to this as I have done this myself.)
    - I threw curveball questions to extract genuine answers that relates to my goal (which is to confirm my assumptions).
    - I believe people like to talk about themselves.
    - Hypothesis: Once you get people talking, you need to include long pauses, which causes them to feel like they need to say more for me to talk.
    - The group interview proved this hypothesis.
    - I believe I got genuine answers.
