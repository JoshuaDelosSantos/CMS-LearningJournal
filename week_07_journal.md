### Key theme files in a custom theme:
A WordPress theme consits of essential PHP files that control different aspects of the website.
- style.css 
- functions.php - able to aadd custom functionality such as enqueing styles
- index.php - the main template file
- header.php - the site's head section and navigation
- footer.php
- sidebar.php - if applicable
- single.php - tempalte for individual posts
- page.php - template for individual pages
- archive.php - template for category, tag and archives

I believe that understanding these core files is important because they form the foundation of any WordPress theme. Each file serves a specific purpose in the theme architecture, allowing for modular development and separation of concerns. 

### Template heirarchy for dynamic content:
- WordPress selects the right template based on heirarchy.
- For example:
    - If a user visits a category page, WordPress checks for these templates in order:
        - category-slug.php
        - category-ID.php
        - category.php
        - archive.php
        - index.php

This may allow developers to create both highly specific templates for particular content and general templates as fallbacks. Without this system, we would need to manually determine which template to use for each page request, making theme development much more complex and error-prone.

### WordPress loop:
- The loop is how WordPress fetches and displays posts dynamically.
- This concept is very important for the project and to make sure our theme is reusable.

### Hooks:
- Hooks allow adding or modifying theme functionality without changing core files.
- Example:
    ```
    function my_custom_footer_text() {
    echo '<p>Powered by My Custom Theme.</p>';
    }
    add_action('wp_footer', 'my_custom_footer_text');
    ```
- Hooks keep my modifications separate and upgrade-safe.
